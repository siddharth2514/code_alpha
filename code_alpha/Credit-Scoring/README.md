https://www.kaggle.com/c/bankbirubutuhkamu/data

### Motivation

This task is important because it is tedious for a bank to supervise every single client's account and decide whether that account will conduct credit default or not. Especially when the said bank has millions of clients worldwide. 

### TODO  

Upload short tutorials in the future when time permits.
